## Conclusion 
This project offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and enhancing customer satisfaction. By conducting a detailed analysis of customer feedback, it reveals actionable insights into trends of dissatisfaction across various demographics and behaviours. Key findings identify critical areas for improvement, such as age-related dissatisfaction peaks and the need to enhance service quality and website usability.

The study also highlights the significance of loyalty programmes in shaping customer experiences, noting that non-members report higher satisfaction in some areas. With an NPS of -100, the findings indicate an urgent need for substantial improvements in customer service.

By leveraging these insights, businesses can effectively address the underlying causes of dissatisfaction, refine their services, and significantly boost overall customer loyalty and satisfaction.
